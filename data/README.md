## Data in this folder is "git ignored".

Whatever you add to this folder will not be tracked by git.

As a good practice, you should inform your team members about this folder and its contents, and how to obtain the data.

Although you can see this README file and the directory it is in, you cannot see the data it contains. This is because I committed this `README.md` first and later added this directory to the .gitignore file.
