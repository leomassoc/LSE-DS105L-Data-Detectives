# DS105L Team Project - Data Detectives ðŸ•µ

Does education still matter in the XXI century? Do we need a Bachelorâ€™s degree to succeed in the professional world? Is inequality linked into education or salary? 
We decided to analyse the impact that education has on individuals' salary: is it responsible for higher wages?. As you will be able to see in the [Behind the Scenes]() page we diversified our sources, after a careful factcheck and reliability control.
