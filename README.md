### _An analysis of the impact of education on salary in the United States_
### DS105L Team Project by Data Detectives 🕵

Does education still matter in the XXI century? Do we need a Bachelor’s degree to succeed in the professional world? Is inequality linked to education and/or salary? 

We decided to analyse the impact that education has on individuals' salary: is it responsible for higher wages?. As you will be able to see in the [Behind the Scenes](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leomassoc/LSE-DS105L-Data-Detectives/main/docs/HTML/behind-the-scenes.html) page we diversified our sources, after a careful factcheck and reliability control.
