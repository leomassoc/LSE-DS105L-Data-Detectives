      <h2>Should you drop-out: An analysis of the impact of education on salary in the United States.</h2>
      <p>
        Our project aims to evaluate the effect of education on professional success. As students, we hope to investigate if education drives our future salaries and whether the time we spend at educational facilities is actually worth it in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship between education and income is a well-studied topic in the social sciences, and researchers have used a range of methods to understand this relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our main hypothesis is based on the <strong>human capital theory</strong>. This theory suggests that education is an investment in an individual's human capital, which can lead to higher wages and greater earning potential over their lifetime. Human capital theory suggests that education is a key determinant of an individual's income, and that higher levels of education are associated with higher levels of income.
      </p>
      <p>
        While regression analysis can be used to estimate the relationship between education and income, given we cannot control for every potential confounder, we will use correlation analysis to examine the strength of the relationship between education and income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the limited timeframe of this project, we will focus on the United States alone to test our hypothesis.
