      <h2>Unveiling the Reliability of Our Research and Methods</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the fascinating world behind the scenes of our research endeavor. In this section, we delve into the code-intensive aspects that underpin the reliability of our findings and methodologies. Our team of authors, committed to ensuring a diversity of ideas and perspectives, has diligently divided the tasks involved. This meticulous approach guarantees a comprehensive exploration, free from any biases that may hinder the integrity of our research.</p>
      <span style="font-style: italic; color: #999999;">The <a href="https://github.com/leomassoc/LSE-DS105L-Data-Detectives/tree/main/notebooks">notebooks</a> of our repository has been organised in order to provide different aspects and steps in our research and do not necessarily reflect the order of neither this page nor the analysis one.</span>
    </section>  
      <h3>1) Data Collection</h3>
      <section>
        <p>Our main and initial source was the <a href="https://www.census.gov/"> Census.gov </a> API, a treasure trove of comprehensive data capturing various variables that illuminate the intricacies of US society. To kick-start our research, we accessed the API's JSON file using the provided API Key. This invaluable resource furnished us with crucial information on the percentage of educational attainment and the number of educational firms across different counties. </p>
        <section style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="fig12.png" alt="Fig 12" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        </section> 
        <p>To streamline our analysis, we converted the obtained data into a Pandas data frame, facilitating a more organized and user-friendly format.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Census.gov API, we incorporated other valuable sources available in CSV or Excel formats. Leveraging the versatility of the Pandas library, we seamlessly imported and processed these files for further examination.</p>
        <img src="fig13.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

      </section>    
      <h3>2) Data Cleaning</h3>
      <p>To establish a solid foundation for our analysis, we undertook meticulous data cleaning procedures. We pruned unnecessary columns, focusing solely on California's data for our initial exploration. The following steps outline our data cleaning process for the American Community Survey (ACS) survey database:
      </p>
      <img src="fig14.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    
      <p>Next, we changed the variable types from the ECS Census Database and prepared it to be merged with the other pandas dataframe from the Bureau of Economic data.</p>
      
      <h3>3) Data Merging</h3>
      <p>Based on these two datasets, from the economic and the American Community Survey Census, we merged them and selected California as the first state we were going to take a look at. To avoid possible sources of conflicting data we chose 2017 for both of these census.</p>
      <img src="fig15.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>The first merge was between the two previously mentioned Census databases based on the county number. We encountered some difficulties as the ECS dataset included more counties than the ACS dataset (48 compared to 40, respectively, for the California state). However, with the given county sample, we were still able to explore trends in California. </p>
      
      <h3>4) Transforming our Data</h3>
      <p>Furthermore, we realized that the US government uses two similar codes on its data to classify each county, GEO_ID and and GEO_FIPS. Thus, we changed the GEO_FIPS column on our merged census pandas dataframe to match the GEO_ID data.</p>
      <img src="fig16.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>This made it possible for us to another dataset which contained National Income from 2009 to 2018 per county based on its GEO_ID. Meaning we could merge it with our pandas dataset which contains info on educational institutions and Percentage of those with a Bachelor’s degree in each county based on the GEO_ID Column. </p>
      <img src="fig17.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>With all of this so far, we have been able to create a pandas data frame containing data on each county on education and income using GEO_ID to quickly identify them.</p>
      
      <h3>5) Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>We created scatter plots to easily visualize and identify possible trends between education and salary.</p>
      <p> <a href="https://github.com/leomassoc/LSE-DS105L-Data-Detectives/blob/1bb90d2974ce89b07b19217100f7fc7b760c96df/notebooks/NB5%20County%20Level%20Analysis.ipynb"> Notebook 5 </a> features scatterplots for all US states, showcasing their GDP per Capita plotted against the Percent of Population with  a Bachelor’s degree. The following code was used to create these plots.</p>
      <img src="fig18.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>Further analysis required identifying the counties with the highest values of GDP per Capita and Percent of Population with a Bachelor’s degree. As you can see below, the original dataframe was sorted into two separate data frames with the 25 highest x and y-values, respectively. The code for the scatterplot was modified to include labels for these counties, showing the US state from which they belong to. </p>
      <img src="fig19.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
      <p>In <a href="https://github.com/leomassoc/LSE-DS105L-Data-Detectives/blob/1bb90d2974ce89b07b19217100f7fc7b760c96df/notebooks/NB5%20County%20Level%20Analysis.ipynb">Notebook 5 </a> we also found the states with counties that were amongst the highest GDP per Capita’s and Education Attainment. Below, the ‘common_values’ set is used to store these states and eliminate duplicates. It is then converted to a list, and then the states extrapolated from their numbers using the data frame created in <a href="https://github.com/leomassoc/LSE-DS105L-Data-Detectives/blob/1bb90d2974ce89b07b19217100f7fc7b760c96df/notebooks/NB2%20Creation%20of%20a%20final%20Data%20Frame.ipynb"> Notebook 2 </a> .</p>
      <img src="fig20.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 50%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
    
      <section>
        <h3>6) Forecasting</h3>
        <p>In <a href="https://github.com/leomassoc/LSE-DS105L-Data-Detectives/blob/main/notebooks/NB3%20Forecasting.ipynb"> Notebook 3</a> we only focus on the forecasting of the education and GDP trends. To do such analysis we used longer temporal data frames that could picture the situation in the US in the past. The economic data is retrieved from the World Bank, while the college percentage is retrieved from a .xlsx file from the Census.gov. We opened the data and we plotted it out. We had to be careful with the units of measurements. In the first case, for the GDP, the levels were ranging from 200 000 to 600 000, while in the second, the percentages were shifting from 5 to 40. After that, we immediately noticed a positive trend in both elements, as we noted in the analysis. The actual forecast was made through the "Prophet" library, that automatically generates a forecast for the period set. The graph generated shows the forecast with a upper and lower error margin. Before that, we made sure to adapt the data frame to the requirements of the library, i.e. renaming the date to "ds" (after having transformed it to date-time format) and y as the variable.</p>
        <img src="fig21.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p>We also decided to plot out a line on the year 2020 to highlight the pandemic effects. The code follows.</p>
        <img src="fig22.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p>Lastly, we merged once again the two forecasts to obtain a single final merged plot, as shown below.</p>
        <img src="fig23.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
