      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        For the purpose of conducting our project, we refer to the data from <strong>Census.Gov</strong> that provides information on educational levels, educational institutions, and salaries in U.S. counties. First, educational levels represent the percentage of people above 25 years old with a Bachelor's degree. Then, from the "Firms" API, we were able to retrieve the number of educational centers per county. Lastly, we used an Excel file from the Economic Bureau to retrieve GDP per county, representative of our salary data. From the Census database, we have chosen two datasets – the Economic Census Survey (ECS) and the American Community Survey (ACS) – containing our variables of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data Source:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GDP: CSV file from the World Bank, GDP per capita from 1960 adjusted to 2015 inflation rate. <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD">gdp_us_over_time.csv</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          EDUCATION: Excel file from the US Census Bureau, some adjustments (no edit to data, only to format) <a href="behind-the-scenes.html">were made</a>.
        </li>

      <p>
        As indicators of working success, we decided to use GDP per capita (referred to as GDP p.c.), as it is an efficient measure of citizens' performance. While we acknowledge that money is not everything in life and other factors are important (e.g., job impact on the world, job satisfaction, popularity), they are subjective and hard to retrieve. Therefore, we will focus on GDP p.c. as a salary indicator, and for measuring higher education levels, we will use the Census Bureau data on College/Bachelor’s Degrees attainment, providing us with a basic understanding of educational attainment in the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        The historical data already shows a strong incremental correlation between the two elements, with the GDP p.c. rising, with a slopes due to cyclical recession, especially prominent around the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.

        A small correlation is already noticeable, with both impacted by the pandemic (although we cannot be already sure that they are strictly correlated). We compare them in the next graph.

      <p>A correlation is evident. But is it strictly related? Is economic increase just a common trend over time? How can we be sure that the economic increase is strictly due to the percentage of college education?</p>
      <p>n is more relevant. Richer counties are more educated.</p>
