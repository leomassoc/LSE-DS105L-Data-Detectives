      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        For our analysis, we will critically examine the education-salary trend since 1940, along with a small forecast for the next 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>The historical data already shows a strong incremental correlation between the two elements, with the GDP p.c. rising, with a slopes due to cyclical recession, especially prominent around the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>
      <p>The black dots represent the annual value, the blue line is the actual forecast with the marginal error indicated in the light blue shade.</p>
      <p>Also, we have marked the pandemic year 2022, to show the negative impact it had on both elements.</p>

      <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Fig. 1: A first look at US GDP per capita over the years with a small forecast of the 2020-2030 period. COVID-19 year is marked by a red line.</p>

    <section style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="fig2.png" alt="Fig 2" style="width: 60%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Fig. 2: A first look at US College Percentage over the years with a small forecast of the 2020-2030 period. COVID-19 year is marked by a red line.</p>
    </section>

    <p>A correlation is evident. But is it strictly related? Is economic increase just a common trend over time? How can we be sure that the economic increase is strictly due to the percentage of college education? Is there a similar trend in every state in the United States?</p>
   
    <section style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="fig3.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 60%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Fig. 3: College Percentage and GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$) and forecasts for the 2023-2033 period.</p>
    </section>

    <p>A correlation is evident. But is it strictly related? Is economic increase just a common trend over time? How can we be sure that the economic increase is strictly due to the percentage of college education?</p>
    <p>You can also notice that the GDP trend slightly fluctuates every couple of year (1969-79) or more. We are not sure if this is due to cyclical recession or external factors. In the Education data, this trend is slightly less present. As we will discuss in <a href="results.html">Results and Conclusions </a> , we could see if events that had an impact on GDP also influences the college percentage but we would need more data on which events are responsible for an economic decrease.</p>
    <p>We have now verified that at a national level and over the years both GDP and Educational Attainment rate increased in the United States. This is undoubtedly a positive phenomenon, meaning that the two are for sure related as the richer the country, the higher the education percentage.</p>

    <p>We could end our research here but we are still not satisfied enough we want to cover some other points, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does this trend appear in all states (of the US)?</li>
      <li>Is this trend the same for everyone (we use data on educational attainment and GDP per race to understand the possible “returns to education” for different counties based on racial majority) </li>
      <li>Which is the state with the highest correlation?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we acknowledge a correlation, we proceed to analyse the data at a county level, where the coefficient is higher.</p>
