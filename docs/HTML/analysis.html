      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>First, let's provide some context!</p>
      <p>As indicators of working success, we decided to use GDP per capita (referred to as GDP p.c.), as it is an efficient measure of citizens' performance. While we acknowledge that money is not everything in life and other factors are important (e.g., job impact on the world, job satisfaction, popularity), they are subjective and hard to retrieve. Therefore, we will focus on GDP p.c. as a salary indicator, and for measuring higher education levels, we will use the Census Bureau data on College/Bachelorâ€™s Degrees attainment, providing us with a basic understanding of educational attainment in the country.</p>
      <p>For our analysis, we will critically examine the education-salary trend since 1940, along with a small forecast for the next 10 years.</p>
      <h3>1) Data Collection</h3>
      <p>We collected data through the API from Census.gov.</p>
    
      <h3>2) Data Cleaning</h3>
      <p>We removed unnecessary columns and kept only data from California for initial analysis. Here are the steps we took to clean the data from the ACS survey database:</p>
      <p>(insert screenshot or code snippet)</p>
    
      <p>Next, we changed the variable types from the ECS Census Database and prepared it to be merged with the other pandas dataframe from the ACS data.</p>

      <h3>3) Data Merging</h3>
      <p>We merged the three final datasets together, establishing a merging point and formatting the final pandas dataframe.</p>
      <p>To get the name of the counties, we used a list of counties from the census to create a pandas dataframe that could be merged with the combined Census dataframe.</p>
      <p>(insert screenshot or code snippet)</p>
      <p>The first merge was between the two previously mentioned Census databases based on the county number. We encountered some difficulties as the ECN dataset included more counties than the ACS dataset (48 compared to 40, respectively, for the California state). However, we were still able to explore trends in California.</p>
      
      <h3>4) Transforming our Data</h3>

      <h3>5) Data Visualization</h3>
      <p>We created scatter plots to easily visualize and identify possible trends between education and salary.</p>
