      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        For our analysis, we will critically examine the education-salary trend since 1940, along with a small forecast for the next 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>The historical data already shows a strong incremental correlation between the two elements, with the GDP p.c. rising, with a slopes due to cyclical recession, especially prominent around the 2008 financial crisis and 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic.</p>
      <p>The black dots represent the annual value, the blue line is the actual forecast with the marginal error indicated in the light blue shade.</p>
      <p>Also, we have marked the pandemic year 2022, to show the negative impact it had on both elements.</p>
    </section>

      <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Fig. 1: A first look at US GDP per capita over the years with a small forecast of the 2020-2030 period. COVID-19 year is marked by a red line.</p>

        <img src="fig2.png" alt="Fig 2" style="width: 60%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Fig. 2: A first look at US College Percentage over the years with a small forecast of the 2020-2030 period. COVID-19 year is marked by a red line.</p>
    </section>

    <p>A correlation is evident. But is it strictly related? Is economic increase just a common trend over time? How can we be sure that the economic increase is strictly due to the percentage of college education? Is there a similar trend in every state in the United States?</p>
   
    <section style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="fig3.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 60%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
        <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Fig. 3: College Percentage and GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$) and forecasts for the 2023-2033 period.</p>
    </section>

    <p>A correlation is evident. But is it strictly related? Is economic increase just a common trend over time? How can we be sure that the economic increase is strictly due to the percentage of college education?</p>
    <p>You can also notice that the GDP trend slightly fluctuates every couple of year (1969-79) or more. We are not sure if this is due to cyclical recession or external factors. In the Education data, this trend is slightly less present. As we will discuss in <a href="results.html">Implications </a> , we could see if events that had an impact on GDP also influences the college percentage but we would need more data on which events are responsible for an economic decrease.</p>
    <p>We have now verified that at a national level and over the years both GDP and Educational Attainment rate increased in the United States. This is undoubtedly a positive phenomenon, meaning that the two are for sure related as the richer the country, the higher the education percentage.</p>

    <p>We could end our research here but we are still not satisfied enough we want to cover some other points, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does this trend appear in all states (of the US)?</li>
      <li>Is this trend the same for everyone (we use data on educational attainment and GDP per race to understand the possible “returns to education” for different counties based on racial majority) </li>
      <li>Which is the state with the highest correlation?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we acknowledge a correlation, we proceed to analyse the data at a county level, where the coefficient is higher.</p>
    
    <section>
      <section>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> We start off by retrieving the education data through the Census API (to keep this page unpolluted, we left a detailed and coded explanation in the “Behind the Scenes” page). Initially, we looked at the relation between Bachelor’s degree and GDP p.c. amongst the counties of California. In our research, we also considered the number of educational institutions (kindergarten, primary, middle, high school, colleges, institutes and universities) to measure the investments made by the counties, states and the United States government into education.</p>
        <p>Data are retrieved from three different datasets and then merged: we used the "GEO_ID" (the geographical variable used by the census) to complete the merging process.</p>
        <p>In Notebook 1, we obtained a single dataframe for the county of California. We decided to plot it to visually analyse the first results. The correlation coefficient is 0.722, already quite significative.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>Both values were recorded in 2017: unfortunately we are missing longer temporal datasets.</p>
          <img src="fig4.png" alt="Fig 4" style="width: 60%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
          <p>The correlation between the two is more prominent on a state level (California). We proceed to show the trends at a state level: the correlation is not as strong as at the county level. We will investigate the possible reasons in the next paragraphs.</p>
