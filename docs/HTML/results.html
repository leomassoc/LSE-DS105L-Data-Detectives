      <h2>Implications</h2>
      <section>
      <h3>Is it the same for everyone?</h3>
        <p>Although so far we have seen a positive trend in many states and slightly at the national level between average higher educational attainment and national income among counties, it does not show the whole story. Is this trend potentially stronger when looking at counties with a population that is mostly white? Or one that is mostly black?</p>
        <p> While we did not have enough time to do further statistical testing to compare how strongly there is a relationship is between race, education and income, we are already able to see some preliminary trends. Our analysis have allowed us to suggest that this is a potentially important area to further research since the gains to education for a county might be different depending on the characteristics of its population. This would imply that there is a variable other than education leading both national income and education to increase in those counties, making education not as important as this third factor. </p>
        <p>Here we look at counties in North Carolina, and see that the overall trend when looking at all races between education and national income differs when we only select counties with majority white, black or native populations.</p>

        <h3>Research Limitations</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first clear limitation is the spatial one: we only focused on the US as one of the largest and easiest countries to analyze due to its economy. This trend, however, may not be visible in other countries. → a further point should be the one of expanding the sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            The second limitation concerns the causal inference. What comes first? Education or salary: does richer families allow their children to study more or is a higher level of education that allowed individuals to earn more and jump from one social class to another. → having data on individuals’ level of attainment and their salary would have helped instead of having access to aggregate data only.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, we could expand our research by further analyzing whether adverse events (economic crisis, pandemic, recession, wars) influence the College percentage. For that, we would need more evidence and data on how much different events affect the economy and education.
