      <h2>Implications: Exploring the Relationship Between Education and Income</h2>
      <p>As researchers, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis to examine the relationship between education and income, aiming to shed light on the factors that define one's financial well-being. Our findings have significant implications for individuals, communities, and policymakers. In this report, we will present our key observations and delve into the details, substantiating our hypothesis that education plays a positive role in determining income.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Confirmation of a Positive Relationship
          </h3>
          <p>To validate our hypothesis, we conducted an extensive analysis, examining the same trends in numerous states. The results unequivocally confirmed a positive relationship between education and income. By plotting the GDP per capita against education attainment at a state level, we obtained scatterplots showcasing the data points of individual counties.          </p>
          <p>We initiated our investigation by analyzing the three most populous states in the US: California, Texas, and Florida. Figure 1 illustrates scatterplots for these states, accompanied by their respective correlation coefficients. The coefficients, calculated as 0.23, 0.10, and 0.09, provide initial insights into the relationship between education attainment and GDP per capita.</p>
          <section style="text-align: center;">

            <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Figure 1: scatterplots for the 3 highest populated states in the US (California, Texas and Florida), with their correlation coefficients of 0.23, 0.10, 0.09 respectively.</p>
          </section>

          <h3>Average Correlation Coefficient and Inferences</h3> 
          <p>To further test our hypothesis, we calculated the correlation coefficient for each state by compiling data from all its counties. While the scatterplots for the three most populous states indicated relatively unchanging percentages of the population with a Bachelor's degree in relation to GDP per capita, the average correlation coefficient across all states was approximately +0.118. While this value does not represent a strong relationship, it does lend support to our theory.</p>
          <section style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="fig7.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 70%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Figure 2: Exploring States with the Highest Correlation Coefficients
            </p>
          </section>   
          <p>To gain a deeper understanding, we examined the five states exhibiting the highest correlation coefficients. Notably, these states were characterized by lower population counts and were not necessarily economic powerhouses. The combined population of these states amounted to 7,463,681. Figure 2 presents scatterplots for these states: Delaware, Hawaii, Alaska, Nevada, and Rhode Island. However, due to the limited number of counties, these plots alone do not provide a reliable basis for drawing conclusive inferences.
          </p>
          <p>Next, we turned our attention to the states with the lowest correlation coefficients. These states boasted a higher number of counties, thereby enhancing the reliability of the inferences drawn from their correlation coefficients. Figure 3 displays scatterplots for these states: South Dakota, Vermont, New Jersey, West Virginia, and New Hampshire. Intriguingly, we observed a slight decline in the percentage of the population with a Bachelor's degree as GDP per capita increased in these states.

          <h3>Interpreting the Average Correlation Coefficient
          </h3>
          <p>Our research led us to calculate an average correlation coefficient of 0.118 between GDP per capita and education attainment. While this figure does indicate a positive relationship, it is still in proximity to zero, signifying a lack of strong correlation. To discern the nature of this relationship, further analysis is necessary to determine whether GDP per capita acts as a determinant of higher education attainment or vice versa.

          </p>
          <section style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="fig9.png" alt="Fig 3" style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
            <p class="chart-description" style="text-align: center; color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Figure 4 shows scatterplots of all US counties’ GDP per Capita plotted against their Percent of Population with a Bachelor’s degree, with the gradient of the dots determined by the number of educational institutions of each county.</p>
          </section> 
          <p>Figure 4 encompasses scatterplots of all US counties, portraying GDP per capita plotted against the percentage of the population with a Bachelor's degree. Notably, the gradient of the data points is determined by the number of educational institutions within each county. These plots clearly demonstrate a correlation between the number of educational institutions and the percentage of the population with a Bachelor's degree, thereby lending credibility to the assessment of educational attainment based on these variables.</p>
          
          <h3>Analysis of Outlier Counties          </h3> 
          <p>Upon examining the scatterplots, we identified counties that deviated significantly from the expected patterns. California, State 11, State 22, and State 36 exhibited counties with notably high GDP per capita, while State 48 and State 37 boasted counties with the highest educational attainment. Surprisingly, only nine out of the top 25 counties in terms of GDP per capita and the percentage of the population with a Bachelor's degree were shared across the states of 8, 48, 51, 17, 8, 13, 36, 37, and 40. This observation suggests that these states achieve a balance between GDP and higher education attainment, further bolstering the notion that education is a crucial determinant of GDP per capita.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Is it the same for everyone?</h3>
            <p>While our analysis showcased a positive trend between average higher educational attainment and national income among counties, it is vital to explore whether this trend differs among counties predominantly composed of different racial demographics. Although we were unable to conduct extensive statistical testing within the given timeframe, preliminary observations suggest the existence of varying relationships between race, education, and income. This finding emphasizes the importance of further research in this area, as it indicates that the benefits of education for a county may differ based on the characteristics of its population. Moreover, this implies the presence of a third variable, beyond education, that influences both national income and education in these counties.</p>
            <h4>Counties in North Carolina: Race and Education
            </h4>
            <p> To provide initial insights into the intersection of race, education, and income, we examined counties in North Carolina. Our analysis revealed distinct trends when considering counties with majority white, black, or native populations. This preliminary exploration indicates the need for more comprehensive statistical testing to understand the nuanced relationship between race, education, and income fully. </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Research Limitations</h3>
          <p>While our research endeavors to shed light on the relationship between education and income, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations to maintain a comprehensive perspective. We recognize the following limitations:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Spatial Limitation: </strong> Our analysis solely focused on the United States, one of the largest and most accessible countries for economic analysis. However, it is crucial to expand our sources and examine whether similar trends exist in other countries.
            <li>
              <strong>Causal Inference: </strong> Determining causality between education and income presents a challenge. Does a higher income allow families to invest more in education, or does higher education lead to increased earning potential and social mobility? Access to individual-level data on attainment and salaries would greatly enhance our ability to draw accurate conclusions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Further Analysis: </strong> An avenue for expanding our research would involve analyzing the impact of adverse events, such as economic crises, pandemics, recessions, and wars, on the percentage of the population pursuing higher education. This would require comprehensive evidence and data to understand the extent to which these events affect the economy and education.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Our research provides valuable insights into the relationship between education and income, showcasing a positive trend across many states and counties. While the average correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship, its proximity to zero suggests the need for further investigation. Additionally, preliminary observations suggest that the relationship may vary based on the racial demographics of counties. Despite the limitations, our findings emphasize the importance of education in determining income and call for continued exploration in this field to unravel the intricate dynamics at play.</p>
